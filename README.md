# SkyPi

This program is mainly dedicated to astronomy live video with live treatments.

This software runs with a raspberry pi (at least 3B+ or better 4)

This program require a picamera V2.

You will also need :

    Python 3
    openCV
    numpy
    pillow
    picamera

You will also have to create 2 directories in you installation directory :

    one for the images you will acquire
    one for the video you will acquire

This is an old version of SkyPi and i guess it must get bugs. This software won't get any update (no further developments).
